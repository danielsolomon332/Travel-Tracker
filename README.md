## Setup
- Clone down this repo
- `cd` into directory
- run `npm install` to install project dependencies
- run `npm start` to start server
- open the location of the hosted URL, generally http://localhost.8080

- Additionally, we will need to run the data server:
- Clone [this local server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) down to your machine. Not into the same directory!
- run `npm install` to install project dependencies
- run `npm start` to start server
- After ensuring that both servers are running, the Travel Tracker app should be fully operational at http://localhost:8080/
